        <h4>Project 3- Universal Testing Machine</h4>
        <p>UTM(Universal Testing Machine)is a machine which helps us to find strength of a material by computing its
            stress vs strain graph using data of current change in motor, it was a group project with group of 6
            students under our institute's makerspace course ,in this project i deal with design of UTM , mechanical
            data analysis (gear ratio , dimensions,stress, motor power), soldering and lathe manufacturing. </p>
